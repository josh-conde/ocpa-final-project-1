                <h2>Why this topic?</h2>
                <p>I chose this topic because astronomy, space travel, and astrophysics have always fascinated me since I could remember. Growing up in Florida, I rememebr days of my mom and I watching the shuttle launches on tv only to run outside with binoculars and watch the smoke plume travel behind 7 people set out to further understand space itself. Ever since the first time experiencing that, my childhood dream was to be on that spacecraft.</p>
                <p>One of my 5th grade field trips was to Kennedy Space Center where we got to spend the night under a real Saturn V rocket. This rocket was responsible for taking several astronauts to the moon and back and after that I was hooked. I began to do research on any and everything space-related. When I saw Jupiter and its moons through a telescope that put me in awe of the size of space itself and everything that lies within and beyond Earth's orbit.</p>

                <h2>About me</h2>
                <p>My name is Joshua Conde and I am currently a student at Pinellas Technical College for front end web development. With astronomy and astrophysics being my lifelong passion, it is also an extremely lucrative industry to establish yourself into. With the path my life has chosen, I am content with keeping that as a passion and not merging that into a career.</p>
                <p>I  have always had an eye for design and with technology constantly growing and changing, I felt this career choice would fulfill me. I like to be able to create things while also using my problem-solving skills to challenge me and keep it interesting.  </p>
